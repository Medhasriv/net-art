    <h1>Our connections.</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Medhasri Veldurthi</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The three artworks I have chosen primarily come together based on the idea of connectedness. We as humans see ourselves 
        as starkly different from one another, yet we are all one in the same and I see that each of these pieces reflects that 
        sentiment in a unique way. The first piece I have chosen, STARRYNIGHT is the very definition of connection. The element 
        of human interaction brings together how we certain things as “brighter” or “connected” but those are all just an illusion 
        we conjure ourselves. At the end of the day, each of these archived emails is simply a star in which we denote meaning, much 
        in the way that we view ourselves. Therefore, the connections we make amongst ourselves are also an illusion as we are all one 
        in the same, The next piece, Apartments, is simple yet conveys this image clearly. I feel as though this brings together the 
        idea that people each have their own sense of home yet the simple nature of the activities described show all of us have the
        most primal of associations for each of these spaces. Finally, the piece In:verse is slightly different from the other two in          
        the sense that it emphasizes the user's interactions. Once again, the user can connect and themselves sees how despite each of
        the words having a single meaning, put together they can generate unique pieces that strike the eye. Once again, this is a 
        reflection of how we view ourselves and attach meaning to our connections to generate a greater picture than the static 
        representation itself. Overall, I enjoy how each of these pieces manages to foster a sense of community.

        The idea of this piece is an archive of emails as stars, where each star becomes brighter the more it is visited and 
        constellations are formed amongst the keywords.

        The pieces base a linear meaning behind each of the words the user types to generate art through programming.
