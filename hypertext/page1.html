    <h1>Lost at sea.</h1>
    <p>
        You wake up, on a boat stranded at sea with nothing but ocean to your left or your right. The sun hangs low in the sky. Is it dawn or dusk? 
    </p>
    <p>You only hold two things to your name...what was that name?</p>
    <p>A paddle and an oar.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
        <a href="page2.html">You paddle towards the sun.</a>
        <a href="page3.html">You paddle away the sun.</a>
        <a href="page4.html">You pdrink some water.</a>
